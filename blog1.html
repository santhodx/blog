<blockquote>HTML is one area which I am not familiar and have breif knowledge about. Therefore, everything I have learnt/learning from CS 347 
   from the very beginning helps in the development of a core foundation about HTML and CSS. Monocolumn Design is something I want to 
   talk about in this blog. I have seen this design on several websites. Even on the wedding cards in India one could often find the 
   Monocolumn Design used.</blockquote>
 
<blockquote>  Monocolumn pattern is a single column layout design where we implement the box-model idea. We have a fixed width column on the
    webpage where we write all the contents. The column is centered by setting the margin to (0,auto). Thus it centers the column on the 
webpage. Few key point take aways while creating the pattern were: </blockquote>

<div class="list">
<ul>
    <li>
        Setting the height to 'min-height' and giving value 100vh. This allows users to scroll down the page without any interruptions to the layout
        even if you have numerous contents. 
    </li>
    <li>
        To remove the whitespace between the body and the column, you should include padding to the column and also set the margin of the body
        to 0.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is a feature called box-shadow which helps to set apart the column from the body. The four inputs are x-offset, vertical offset, 
        shadow concentration, and the color.
    </li>
</ul>

The CSS code sample is: <br>

<pre>   
body{ 
   margin:0; 
}
#id{
    width: 960px;
    min-height: 100vh;
    margin: 0,auto;
    box-shadow: 0 0 20px gray;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
