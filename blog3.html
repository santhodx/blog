<blockquote>In this blog I am talking about 'Mark' Attribute in HTML.</blockquote>
 
<blockquote> Mark element is mainly used in HTML as a highlighter. Any sentence wrapped inside the mark tag will be highlighted/ brightened 
    on the webpage to the users. It is used for notation purposes and in recent Google Chrome updates, one can find the usage of mark element 
    used by their developers.  </blockquote>

<blockquote> For instance, if you have made a google search on a specific topic and opened the link displayed, google automatically takes you to the
    relevant content by using the notation/ higlighter feature.
