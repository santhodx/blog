<blockquote>In this blog I am talking about 'Bi-Directional Override' (bdo) Attribute in HTML.</blockquote>
 
<blockquote> bdo attribute helps overrides the direction of the given text, so that the text inside the tag rendered in a 
    different direction. We should mention dir tag inside bdo which decides what direction the text must be. 'ltr' 
    means the text directed from left to right direction. Whereas 'rtl' means that the text will be directed 
    from right to left.  </blockquote>

<blockquote> You dont use it that often. Only used in exceptional situations where you must need to override the normal
    bidirectional rule. dir attribute is still a useful precaution against special cases and against browser bugs.
