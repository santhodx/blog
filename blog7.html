<blockquote>In this blog I am talking about 'z-index' property in CSS.</blockquote>
 
<blockquote> z-index specifies te stack order for an element. An element which has greater stack rder is always in front 
    of elemnts with lower stack order. One of its main advantage is that you are now able to place an image right 
    under the heading or other writings by giving z-index a value of '-1'.     </blockquote>

<blockquote> On the contrary, if value of z-index is 1 the image will display on top of the text. z-index will only 
    work for elements that are positioned such as position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or 
    position: stick.

The code sample within the body is:

    img {
        position: absolute;
        left: 0px;

        z-index: -1;
      }
